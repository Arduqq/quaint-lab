      <p class="intro">When the light from the barricaded windows starts to linger, you notice that it is getting late. Luckily, one of the hibernation cells from the main research lab seems to be quite comfy and malfunctioning. With a yawn, you end up cuddling up in some thick cloth that must have been used as a rug for whatever reason, closing your eyes to get some energy for your next adventure. Thinking about that one cheesy love song that you keep singing to yourself to fall asleep, you start to dream.</p>
      <p>Here are some digital drawings of mine that I feel proud of. I rarely follow any theme and just love doodling ahead to see what I end up with. While I have a lot of fun experimenting with all the possibilties you have in a digital environment, I have to stop myself from not overthinking it.
      </p>
      <p>Social media bombardements turn artistic freedom into a challenge for me where I catch myself thinking about how I could render my art sellable. That is why, I currently try to stay away from taking commissions. I am, however, always eager to draw for friends in an art trade context.

      <h2>Character Designs</h2>
      <p>Creating characters has always been my favourite part of drawing. It helps me think about my own style and how I would like to portray emotions and aesthetics accordingly. To kill my art block I love creating for pet sites or ARPGs like PaperDemon, but most of the time, it's just drawing funny shapes and going with the flow.</p>

      <h2>Scenes</h2>
      <p>Ah the dreaded backgrounds. I love being a cheap ass that uses their photography for backgrounds, but sometimes I try to force myself through it. Again, ARPGs are a perfect cause to make oneself draw your characters in whole scenes, so I try to stick to it whenever I do some studies,</p>
