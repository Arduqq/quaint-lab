        <a href="general" class="general-art"><h3>Digital Artwork</h3>
        <p>I like drawing fun creatures in CSP. It helps me experiment with layering colors on top of each other, yet it's hard to not fall victim to perfectionism.</p></a>
        <a href="https://artur.glitch.me/" class="portfolio"><h3>Portfolio</h3>
        <p>In case anyone wants to see all the things I could do for them, I send them there. My website is not my portfolio. If you would love to make me create for you, feel free to reach out for the prices. It's cheap as I am still developing my showcases.</p></a>
        <a href="/id" class="id-maker"><h3>ID Maker</h3>
        <p>A simple avatar maker like a picrew do create a photo for your next ID! I try to throw in batches of new assets every now and then. Uses JS!</p></a>
        <a href="midveil" class="midveil"><h3>Midveil Characters</h3>
        <p>I really like the site Strudel Caf√©. It's a pet site based on a closed species. As much as I dislike the concept of a closed species, the owners of this place are doing wonderful work and have broken my creator's block multiple times. Here are the things I drew on there!</p></a>
