        <p class="intro">After a long hike across those mountains that your village deemed forsaken, you arrive at quite
          the unusual sight. Traces of a long-forgotten facility would leave you questioning whether things could have
          been different - intact. Working yourself through the piles of reagents, burnt paper and storage mediums, you
          end up in a chamber that seems passable. You might take a rest and fuel up on those gas canisters that were
          lying around next door, you think, as you play with the idea of turning this into a new home. A place to leave
          a
          piece of you behind and to be the actor filling this scene with life and inspiration. </p>

      <p class="summary">Welcome to this little laboratorium of ideas. I'm Artur, and here you can find a bunch of things about myself. Navigate this place with the help of the map. Consider dropping some words in the <a href="/radio">Radio</a>, or just write <a href="/about">me</a> wherever! Enjoy your stay, or have a nice day if you're just stepping by.</p>
