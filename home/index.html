      <p class="intro">After a long hike across those mountains that your village deemed forsaken, you arrive at quite the unusual sight. Traces of a long-forgotten facility would leave you questioning whether things could have been different - intact. Working yourself through the piles of reagents, burnt paper and storage mediums, you end up in a chamber that seems passable. You might take a rest and fuel up on those gas canisters that were lying around next door, you think, as you play with the idea of turning this into a new home. A place to leave a piece of you behind and to be the actor filling this scene with life and inspiration. </p>
