  <h1>The Necronomanifesto: The magic of love and flowers</h1>
    <p><strong>Existence:</strong> <a href="https://fearandhunger.wiki.gg/wiki/Fear_%26_Hunger" target="__blank">Fear & Hunger</a> is a horror RPG dungeon crawler from the mind of Miro Haverinen aka orange. It's the first installment of the series and features the descent of a diverse cast of characters into the depths of the Dungeon of Fear and Hunger. This shrine is dedicated to a game that reinterprets classic inspirations while building a game identity that really resonates with me. With sliced limbs, pregnant figurines and human hydras, this might be the absurdest of games I'd consider comforting. Here I will explain why F&H, despite its cruel, unfair and unforgiving nature, is masterful, and inspiring.</p>
    <p><strong>Nature:</strong> Driven by an individual goal, the four playable characters enter a place that would not accept them. Enemies will sever your limbs with ease. Every step you take, must be cautious. The more you explore the depths, the more entangled you become with the complex burden of divinity of which the characters have many opinions. Soon you understand that this is more than a rescue or assassination mission, but a key event in a living world that will possibly cost your life. This game will make sure you know how vulnerable and weak you are, and what you will have to rely on is your humanity - as paradox as it may seem.</p>
    <p><strong>Magic:</strong> F&H makes it obvious that you will die and this place is not fair. It is devoid of conventional balance. The first experience will scare away mostly anyone. You will have to endure, learn, and possibly cry as you will fail constantly. You will lose hours of progress that may throw off any player. Frustration is something you will have to overcome, and when you do, nothing will stop you from starting the game up again, and again, and again. Finishing this game for the very first time is a gruesome Gauntlet - literally. If you are able to overcome the hurdle of unfairness and add luck to your dwindling arsenal, you may get a glimpse into a rich world that captures cosmic horror, and dark fantasy impressively well. All the concepts, ideas, and overarching themes are pictured with great finesse through gameplay. Given that F&H is an RPG Maker title, this to me is just amazing and inspirational. Handcrafted assets and music by just one person may very well be cool enough, but it's realized in this unique package that I have rarely seen before. It brings me back to my first memories of Silent Hill, my first (and last) team wipe in Darkest Dungeon, as well as the feeling of "just one more attempt" of Bloodborne. I described this game as a 2D Demon's Souls on crack, but it is so much more than just that.</p>
    <p><strong>Vibe:</strong> I won't go into detail about the mechanics that really make the game shine since they should be experienced by everyone on their own. If you loved the Mother series and Undertale, and want the gore, misery, and severity of your actions to be even more impactful, this game is an absolute must. It's cheap, 8 bucks - just grab it on itch. What I want everyone to know is that there are people who clearly love the medium of games, and this is one of those titles. You will not find a cookie-cutter system, overpolished artwork, high-budget music, or awe-inspiring isekai plot lines, but something way more unique and surprisingly cohesive. And that I have been missing from a lot of games lately.</p>
    <p>Worm Girl did an amazing job sumarizing the whole plot of them game without going into great detail into the broader lore. It's such a creative retelling of all endings if they would tie together, so definitely check that out.</p>
