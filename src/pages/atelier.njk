  <p>Imagine a world where your one true purpose is hidden yet vital for you to uncover. Your very body aching to
    unravel this secret as you pursue the many careers this society has to offer. An unending spiral manifested in a
    snail house that feeds on you, creating an inner void when you fail to contribute to the greater good. Here I
    collect all the characters I design for this little art project.</p>
