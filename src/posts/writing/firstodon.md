Since establishing my own Mastodon instance, [Blasius.Club](https://blasius.club), for my friends, I've often discussed ways to welcome new users. While they can understand the medium on their own, discovering content for their timeline can be challenging. Moving away from automatically curated content designed to keep you glued to your screen is tough, so I've collected some suggestions to help everyone get accustomed to the Fediverse. At the end of this post, you'll find all the links I found useful for refining my content feed.

## Visit the Neighborhood

This might seem obvious, but the people on your instance are likely on the same page as you. Check out what the local timeline offers and explore the connections they've already established. This is usually the starting point for everyone, as you can traverse many other instances simply by exploring what the network has to offer. What are the other instances about, and who posts there? Follow them and see where it leads you.

## Join Groups (and maybe Hashtags)

Many don't realize that delightful groups are out there doing all the curating for you. A group is an account that shares content related to a specific topic, as considered by its subscribers. For example, if someone posts about photography, users tag the group to share it with everyone who follows. [Fedi.Directory](https://fedi.directory/tag/fediverse-groups/) has compiled a great list of groups that are helpful for new users. 

If you're more interested in finding people to follow, [Fedi.Directory](https://fedi.directory/) also provides a directory of various people and their profiles. You might want to follow trusted news outlets, find artists on mastodon.art, or ask friends for recommendations. Don't let the platform do everything for you.

Hashtags in the Fediverse are your entry point to connecting with others. By tagging your content appropriately, people will see you on their timeline if they follow that hashtag. While hashtags aren't new, years of hashtag engineering have led to mass-tagging to game algorithms. In the Fediverse, people try to be concise with their tags, contributing to a clean experience free from artificially pushed posts. There's no competition for your position in someone's timeline, so finding interesting hashtags is a great step toward filling your feed.

## Reminisce about the Past

Many fear losing the timeline they've built over time. Fortunately, Twitter's decline has led many to cross-post on other platforms. [Fedifinder](https://fedifinder.glitch.me) is a great tool for finding which of your old contacts are now part of the Fediverse. Just connect the tool to your Twitter account and see what happens. Be aware that Twitter is restricting these services from using their API, so act quickly. Also, don't forget to let people know where they can find your posts now! Share your changes and show your friends the benefits of going federated.

## Enjoy the Empty

This is a time to relax from the overstimulation that social media has brought. It's okay not to have a fresh timeline every hour. Try to get used to a more intimate and controlled experience on the internet for now. Appreciate the posts you might have overlooked, and interact with the people around you. These instances are not meant to fill the Twitter void but to provide a new way to entertain yourself without losing control over consumption.

## Bother Admins

If you feel alone on an instance, don't hesitate to ask admins for help. Let them know if the place feels empty. By relaying other instances, they can help fill the void, so don't hesitate to reach out! What instances do you find interesting? Where are like-minded people? Most smaller instances have become communities, and having administrators this close to users is a blessing. Stay persistent.

## Embrace the Adventure

As with any social medium, it's all about constant refinement. Try not to stress about your empty timeline; instead, spend some of your downtime exploring the Fediverse. Personally, I could spend all day just browsing the instances others have created, which reminds me of the chaotic era of the internet. Have fun with this new platform if microblogging is something you truly enjoy. Embrace the calm before the storm of new users breaking it. Define who you are in these spaces and enjoy social networking that's conscious and in your hands. Don't be afraid to migrate to other instances, and always choose the smaller one.
