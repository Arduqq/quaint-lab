comment: I was driven to Cossetlings because it really reminded me of why I loved the Arborlings of Strudel Caf√©. However, I found it incredibly grindy, and I am not a fan of sending strangers gift art before being allowed to create something for myself. I just went for it without a MYO, and so should you.
