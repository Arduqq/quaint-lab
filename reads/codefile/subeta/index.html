      <h2> <i>Subeta</i>: A Muse in Disguise</h2>

      <p><i>A walk in the public park, the wind blowing at your naked ears, the gravel building up in those shoes that
          you should have thrown out long ago, and, from time to time, you see a squirrel quickly jumping over the tree
          branches that have been losing their leaves quite early this year. You take a deep breath, you exhale and just
          can't wait to go home - to cover in your favorite blanket. Only then you realize that this home that you are
          longing for is of cardboard and that path that you have been walking on is of glue, paper and the most
          beautiful coat of paint. Visiting <i>Subeta</i> is a stroll in a field of splendid dreams that will fade away
          if you lose your focus. Well, for me at least.</i></p>
      <img src="3.png">
      <p>There is something comforting about this site that I fail to put into word. It's not a rush of nostalgia for
        me, but a severe craving for more. I feel immersed by the artwork and the people, up until a point where it
        seems to lose itself. <i>Subeta</i> is a very conventional pet site mechanically, as it mirrors many factors of
        the classical <i>Neopets</i> experience. No wonder, as it was one of the big fan projects of the former titan of
        the genre. With <i>Neopets</i>' clear lack of adult themes, mindful representation and variety in tone,
        <i>Subeta</i> strived to give this other target group a place to thrive. My questions during one year of
        constant playing experience revolved around the potential browser games had, have and will have on internet
        culture and this is where most of said opportunities are buried deep. </p>
      <h3>Daily Clicks per Day</h3>
      <p>The game itself is a simple yet surprisingly unintuitive one. Players are presented with a variety of daily
        tasks that I will denote as <span class="highlight"><b>redeems</b></span>. <span class="highlight">Click the
          link, get the thing, rinse and repeat. Every redeem is quite unique as they focus on collectibles such as
          fruit from an intergalactic tree, a deal from a wanted criminal, or random treasure that you can find in
          bathhouse. It's cute, it's fast, and it opens up even more questions.</span> What would I use those items for?
        Why can I wear them? Should I sell them? I feel like the overall experience is providing me with countless
        decisions that I still struggle to make. </p>
      <img src="4.png">
      <p>What would a game be without the fundamental urge to be an underpaid figure of capitalism. Quickly, one might
        find themselves in the predicament of not having enough of one of the 3 currencies. Here we also encounter the
        most simple way to earn considerable amounts of so-called sP to buy ... stuff! Visit an NPC, buy them stuff,
        give it to them, and get stuff back! Item pools vary and are, quite frankly, difficult to keep track of. <span
          class="junk">Rewards can be arbitrary junk</span>, <span class="junk">cool junk</span> or <span
          class="junk">important junk</span>, which I will elaborate on when we will be talking about the actual pets.
        The things you don't need can be salvaged into currencies, hoarded or sold in one of the numerous user shops
        that serve as a source of income (for most people). If you feel dandy, you can grind up some more tedious tasks
        or play a bunch of very fun mini-games. As you see, there is a whole lot to do on a daily basis, which can leave
        you occupied for multiple hours a day. <span class="junk">Trade junk</span>, <span class="junk">buy junk</span>,
        <span class="junk">look at junk</span>, <span class="junk">use junk</span>! Well, jolly, so much to do! Yet
        where. are. the pets ..<span class="pet">?</span></p>

      <h3>Of Potions and Pets</h3>
      <p>I can't help but sigh when I think about the pets of <i>Subeta</i>. What certainly sparked my interest was the
        multitude of colors a pet could come in. <span class="highlight">Users can use potions or various site mechanics
          to give their plain (yet still gorgeous) pets a new look.</span> Contrary to the whimsical <i>Neopets</i>
        colors like Fairy, Pastel, Chocolate, or a bunch of problematic shit, <i>Subeta</i> comes through with
        Nightmare, Bloodred and Reborn designs for the many species. Not only are most of the designs quite rich, but
        evolving steadily, with occasional redesigns and additions for newer species. What's more is the huge amount of
        experimental pets that have the most amazing and creative designs far off the conventionally cute and pretty
        aesthetic, which made me fall in love with what the site was trying to portray. This could be a place to get
        inspired and DO things. This could leave you thinking about how this poor rat creature ended up with three
        beautiful heads, or how this blob of limbs could be a complex concept of time and space. Now, what would I do if
        those designs sparked my interest? Why in the hell would I adopt something that looks like a cow or a porcupine?
        Well, friend, the answer is a pet page. </p>
      <img src="5.png">
      <p>Four times a week, a spotlight takes place where some pet is posted in the news. The creature at hand will most
        likely be very different to a pet that has been adopted out of the box. Fun layouts, more graphics, a bunch of
        <span class="junk">junk</span>, stats, prose, you can find it all here. To me, this is what it is all about.
        Don't get me wrong, I am not talking about a contest for a spotlight, but the portrayal of creative processes.
        We are six chapters in and only now I manage to express what a pet site can be. <span class="highlight">Aside
          from a generic gameplay loop of fetch, pet sites could have a very intricate role in shaping the internet.
          They are frameworks of media that jumpstart self-assigned and reachable goals through multi-medial and
          creative execution.</span> Every time I think about it, I end up in the world of zines. These are the spaces
        where lots of web art comes to life nowadays. Here's where individuals get into drawing, designing, writing and
        programming. On this basis I will try to argue <span class="highlight">the effort each pet site that I will
          present makes to provide a safer space for minorities, artists and intersectional identities</span>. I will
        try to sketch <b>a pet site as a muse</b> for people who want to get inspired or give their ideas home and
        representation.</p>
      <img src="6.png">
      <h3>A Junkyard for the Wicked</h3>
      <p>Now that we've dug a bit deeper, found this little piece of gold, there is an obvious concern. Me boasting
        about how beautiful and accessible such a pet system is, does not change the fact that <i>Subeta</i> itself is
        struggling to balance those creative, autonomous mechanics well. Frankly, the focus has shifted towards systems
        more lucrative for obvious reasons to keep the site alive. A key element of the site has been the customization
        of user avatars with a large amount of <span class="junk">junk</span> where people are able to create their very
        own custom <span class="junk">junk</span>, which of course is a profitable system at that. A far more complex
        endeavor is the combat system, which has sparked controversy recently. I won't be going into detail as it has
        nothing to do with my point, yet it opens up the question of how all this <span class="junk">junk</span> keeps
        the user base engaged and how it ties in to the world of <span class="pet">virtual pet sites</span>.</p>

      <p>I feel like you might be sick of me calling every item <span class="junk">junk</span> at this point. Honestly,
        I am quite torn on the definition of items. In some games, there even is a dedicated category that introduces
        items as trash; nonetheless, I feel like pet sites have a very special relation to that concept. <span
          class="highlight">Every <i>Subeta</i> <b>item</b> has at least one purpose and can be classified by type and
          rarity</span>. The rarity denotes the accessibility of an item which opens up a bigger discussion that I am
        not (yet) willing to discuss. <span class="highlight">Every item has at least one purpose where users will have
          to decide how they would like to use this item.</span> In an MMORPG context. It is analogues to the concept of
        soulbound items that can either be equipped and used or traded to other players. Will I consume my item and lose
        its value on the market? While tempting in design, the execution on <i>Subeta</i> leaves users clueless when one
        item can be consumed in multiple ways. Items can be read, eaten, played with, worn, used and or put into a pet's
        treasure chest. To put this into perspective, I will present the way I try to classify items personally. <span
          class="highlight"><b><span class="junk">Arbitrary junk</span></b> are items to me that I would not feel any
          attachment to.</span> Those could be items with no unique interaction, progress or mechanic tight to it (i.e.,
        furniture, toys or miscellaneous outliers). <span class="highlight"><b><span class="junk">Cool junk</span></b>
          includes the things that I love and want to include in my gameplay</span>. Items that enable my creativity and
        make me build narratives, characters and concepts. This includes items that are just fun to look at or fascinate
        me. <span class="highlight"><b><span class="junk">Important junk</b> are items that I would like to just delete
          from the game as they are tied to game progression for various achievements.</span> Unfortunately, this is
        where most cool <span class="junk">junk</span> intersects for me, and it is at this point where potentially bad
        design habits may arise. We no longer think about how we could use our new item, but we start to consider if we
        are <span class="highlight">going for completing artificial achievements or not</span>. If we decide to ditch
        the progression, the beloved fight against the Fear of Missing Out (FoMO) begins and we are confronted with new
        questions.</p>

      <img src="7.png">
      <p>Should I read this book to my pet, or should I showcase it on the profile? Should my pet eat this cake, or
        could my avatar use it in any fun way? The answer is quite simply <b>choice paralysis</b> with newcomers ending
        up <span class="highlight">overwhelmed from the abundance of options</span> since the site has been online for
        over a decade now with items being added constantly. That this concept is monetisable goes without saying, which
        leads me back to the very first metaphor. <span class="highlight"><b>The value of pretty items</b> is two-fold.
          Despite the obvious appeal for the audience to buy, more niche and unique themes lead to further inspirations
          for a pet.</span> Users might identify with item sets regarding a certain kind of bug, a specific material, an
        obscure hobby or just a bunch of subtle references to other media. Every new item sparks at least someone's
        motivation to buy a slot for a pet, fill it up with <span class="junk">junk</span> and pamper it to make your
        own concept come to life. <span class="highlight">Contrary to that, a very specific and abstract design will
          deter a majority of users who will struggle to find an item worth the cost. We start to question if we are
          buying for the sake of having the item or genuinely enjoying it.</span> When I saw a collection of books about
        vegetables doing crime, I immediately was thinking about one of my favorite books from my childhood, which made
        me write up a site about a cyber-criminal onion distributing media illegally. This shit is powerful if done
        right, and it is this slippery slope that <i>Subeta</i> will have to take when arguing the creative freedom they
        provide to the user. Are we talking inspiration or aspiration? Should users buy everything there is or
        everything they love? How will we help the user decide?</p>
      <img src="8.png">

      <p>This has been quite the ride for me. I am in love with what <i>Subeta</i> is and what it might have been. Times
        are tough for old media, and I am more than amazed by its implementation and artistic possibilities, yet I can't
        help but think about its flaws. Confusing and incohesive mechanics, choice paralysis, an abundance of <span
          class="junk">junk</span> items most people might not even care about and a multitude of systems that will
        create ridges within a use base that is quite small at that. All that encompasses a core concept that influenced
        and keeps sparking ideas in the hearts of creative minds that just want to find a place to throw in their art,
        stories and opinions in a coat of stylized graphics accessible to a user base of intersectional identities.
        Obviously, we did not touch on everything there is to the site. I will throw in some more questions at the end
        of the post to spark some more ideas. Anyways, here are my personal takeaways, or a <b>tl;dr</b> if you'd like.
      </p>

      <p><span class="pet">Virtual pet sites</span> of the nature of <i>Subeta</i> are websites that can inspire people
        to be creative while providing them hosting possibilities in the scope of the site's aesthetic. They try to
        create immersion through interaction with your pet through items and will provide further stimuli for you to
        improve on it. Despite the availability of an atrocious amount of items, users may be faced with choice
        paralysis as the creative process converges towards "getting the thing" or going towards pre-defined
        achievements rather than investing in one's own goals. Where do we draw the line between giving users artistic
        freedom while making our coin? All that is part of this weird little journey, and I hope to find some more
        answers as I look through other prevalent pet sites out there.</p>

      <p><i>The site in question: <a href="https://subeta.net">Subeta</a>
          <ul>
            <li>How is forum culture still a part of virtual pet sites like Subeta and is there anything to improve on?
            </li>
            <li>What are ways to tie together a multi-system virtual pet site with its functions (Wearables, Battling,
              Pets)?</li>
            <li>What is the degree of freedom users should have when designing their pet pages=</li>
            <li>Where to Persistent Browser-Based Games (PBBG) begin in the pet site context and what are current
              technologies employed in both sub-genres. </li>
